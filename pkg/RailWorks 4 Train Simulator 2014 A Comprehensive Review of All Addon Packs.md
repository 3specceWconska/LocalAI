## Route Editor Tutorials
 
One of the most impressive features of RailWorks 4 - Train Simulator 2014 is the ability to create your own routes using the built-in Route Editor. This tool allows you to design and build your own tracks, stations, scenery, signals, level crossings, speed limits, and more. You can also create your own scenarios with drivable trains and AI traffic. However, the Route Editor can be quite complex and intimidating for beginners, which is why this addon pack is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn how to use it.
 
The Route Editor Tutorials addon pack is a series of video guides that teach you the basics of creating a playable route from start to finish. The tutorials cover topics such as track laying, track tools, gradients, bridges, terrain tools, stations, passenger AI, tunnels, scenario creation, train AI, signals, automated level crossings, and setting speed limits. The tutorials are easy to follow and have a bit of humor as well. They are created by NoOne, a Steam user who has also made other useful guides for Train Simulator games.

The Woodhead Line addon pack includes the Woodhead Line route as it was in the 1950s and 1980s, with accurate track layout, scenery, landmarks, stations, signals, and electrification.
